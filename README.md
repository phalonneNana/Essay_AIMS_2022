# New-method-to-solve-the-problem-of-imbalanced-classes-in-case-of-credit-card-fraud-detection
 This python code is an individual work and also my thesis work which  contains a loss function with penalty to solve the problem of imbalanced classes and also the simple ANN to detect if a transaction is fraudulent or not in the case of credit  card fraud. So with this algorithm, we can easily detect fraudulent transaction with a good precision even if the data of customers are not balanced.
